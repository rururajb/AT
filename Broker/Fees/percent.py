        You have $1000. You want to spend all $1000 on Asset A.
        Your model tells you to purchase 10 of Asset A for $100 each.
        The issue is that if you follow your models recommendation 
        without taking into account commissions (and slippage) you 
        will be forced to go into debt or your broker will simply 
        not execute the order as you lack the necessary money.

        Given:
            consideration = qpc + qp
        Thus:
            q = (consideration) / ((c + 1) * p)
        (where c is commission)

        Keep in mind that this only works for assets with a
